A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.
It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.

```python
import pandas as pd

a = [1,5,8]

mySeries = pd.Series(a)
import pandas as pd

a = [1,5,8]

mySeries = pd.Series(a)

print(mySeries)
    # 0    1      
    # 1    5      
    # 2    8  
```
