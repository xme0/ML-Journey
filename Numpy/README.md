# What is Numpy?
- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
- The array object in numpy is called `ndarray`. We can create `ndarray` object by `array()`
```python
import numpy as np 

my_list = [1,2,3]

my_matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

arr = np.array(my_list)
arr_2d = np.array(my_matrix)

print(arr)
# [1 2 3 ]
print(arr_2d)
# [[1 2 3] 
#  [4 5 6] 
#  [7 8 9]]
```
